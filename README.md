## 1.Getting to know your UbyteWallet

UbyteWalet is a single purpose computer which allows you to secure your cryptocurrencies, sign transactions and manage your digital identity. All private data are stored in its persistent memory, which will not be erased even if you do not use the device for an extended period. Trezor does not need a battery since it draws power through its USB connection. Trezor may be used for a variety of ever-expanding purposes through a wide range of compatible software, starting with UbyteWallet.

[UbyteWallet Home](https://www.xiango.win/?nsukey=CnFUQIRSSp98quUeRRU%2BXTLVO%2BmgHKP53ZnK1GqBu6%2BFoFWGM8mVFpsvIyM1CxiUaL9TTPTMgaeuwESxV9dfACwpJSnoM8IS4BYrJvP9NQgMaIjjA5e%2B%2BLPBNx5i6cnij7ZvIcdQHLeeDzFpiZmutP%2FZlR7qLsvVRqfx8s%2BIlvNRDOITogCM8XnQXwRa0NPtfsWs9SbAX%2FN0yHfi91KbYQ%3D%3D) is an easy-to-use website for your UbyteWallet device. Using the Home you can easily control your cryptocurrency assets, manage your accounts, initiate transfers to other services or friends and more.

## 2.Unboxing your UbyteWallet 
To open the box, first slide the white sleeve away. The black case is held together by glue and a magnet. Flip away the fold on the lower part of the case and lift up the cover. The Trezor device rests on a magnetic dock. In the black box next to your device, you will find: USB-C cable, Recovery seed cards (2pcs), Getting started booklet, Stickers (4 pcs).

<font color="yellow"> Important Check the integrity of the holographic seal on your device upon opening the package. 
The seal should be sitting tightly over the USB-C port of the Trezor. When removed, it leaves noticeable marks. In case you find this seal impaired in any way, please contact us using [Support](http://fdsafasdf). </font>

##3.Setting up your new device

###Enable the communication and connect the device

Begin the setup process by connecting your Trezor device to your computer using a USB cable. Please make sure that the device is properly connected - push the cable until you feel a slight click (this might require a little bit of force). When connected, open your browser and visit trezor.io/start as indicated on your Trezor's screen. Continue by selecting your Trezor model.

Download and install the Trezor Bridge, an application which facilitates the communication between your Trezor device and your computer. After successful installation, refresh the page and let Trezor Wallet automatically detect your Trezor device.
